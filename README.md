# Multi Object Detection

The attacched notebook contains notes, research and python code for multi-object detection. I adapted the code to my own needs, which was originally developed by [Jeremy Howard](http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), co-founder of [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai). Many thanks to Jeremy and [Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel) for allowing me to take part as Fellow.
